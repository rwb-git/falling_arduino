These files are set up for platformio, but are easily converted for the Arduino IDE: choose a project name = "my_name". Rename main.cpp to my_name.ino. Make a project directory named my_name. Copy all the files to that directory except for platformio.ino. Rename main.cpp to my_name.ino. All the other files are ok as-is and should work in the Arduino IDE.
